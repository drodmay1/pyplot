# Matplotlib and pyplot
# Sorting Algorithm Analysis Project

This project provides an analysis of sorting algorithms, specifically focusing on insertion sort and merge sort. The visuals help to illustrate the differences in performance between insertion sort and merge sort.

## Contents

- **Notebook (pyplot.ipynb) Files**: Contains the executed code for analyzing and visualizing the performance of insertion sort and merge sort.
- **HTML Exports**: These are HTML versions of the notebooks for easy viewing without requiring a Jupyter Notebook environment.
- **README.md**: An overview of the project and contents.

## Usage

- The repository from Github has been cloned to local, the notebook has to be open in Jupyter or VSCode, view the exported HTML file directly for the executed results.

## Installation

To run the code in this project, is needed:
- Python 3.x
- `matplotlib` for plotting
